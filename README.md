Rack::Reducer
=============
Filter your app's data via request params, safely and methodically.

Rack::Reducer solves the same problem has Platformatecâ€™s
[HasScope](https://github.com/plataformatec/has_scope), but it works in any Rack
app, with any ORM, and has a simpler, more functional API. Where `has_scope`
requires you to spread filters across your Controllers and Models, Rack::Reducer
lets you put code wherever you like, and encourages you to keep it all in one
place.

Install
-------
Add `rack-reducer` to your Gemfile:
`gem 'rack-reducer', require: 'rack/reducer'`

If your app doesn't `Bundler.require` your whole Gemfile, be sure to
`require rack/reducer` in your code when you need it.

Use
---
Rack::Reducer maps incoming URL params to an array of filter functions you
define. Suppose you have some incoming requests like these...

`GET /artists`  
`GET /artists?name=SZA`  
`GET /artists?name=blake&genre=electronic`

You want to filter your `artists` table by name and/or genre when those
params are present, and return all artists otherwise.

#### Mixin-style
You can use Rack::Reducer as a mixin on your models:

```ruby
# app/models/artist.rb
class Artist < RailsLike::Model
  extend Rack::Reducer
  reduces self.all, filters: [
    ->(:name) { where('lower(name) like ?', "%#{name.downcase}%") },
    ->(:genre) { where(genre: genre) }
  ]
end
```

```ruby
# app/controllers/artists_controller.rb
class ArtistsController < ApplicatonController
  def index
    @artists = Artist.reduce(params)
    @artists.to_json
  end
end
```

#### Functional style
You can also call Rack::Reducer as a function:

```ruby
# cool_sinatra_app.rb
class App < Sinatra::Base
  FILTERS = [
    ->(:name) { where('lower(name) like ?', name.downcase) },
    ->(:genre) { where(genre: genre) }
  ]

  get '/artists' do
    @artists = Rack::Reducer.call(
      params,
      dataset: Artist.all,
      filters: FILTERS
    )
    @artists.to_json # [{ name: 'James Blake', genre: 'electronic' }]
  end
end
```

The mixin style enforces more conventions, and is a Railsier way of writing.
The functional style is more powerful. Both styles are tested and supported.
