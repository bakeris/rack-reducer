Rack::Reducer
=============
Use request params to filter your app's data, safely and methodically.

Rack::Reducer solves the same problem has Platformatecâ€™s
[HasScope](https://github.com/plataformatec/has_scope), but it works in any Rack app, with any ORM, and has a simpler, more functional API. Where `has_scope` requires you to spread filters across your Controllers and Models, Rack::Reducer lets you put code wherever you like, and encourages you to keep it all in once place.
